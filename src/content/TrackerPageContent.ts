  'Excess death rates refer to the number of deaths that occurred over a period of time (such as the year 2020 or 2021) beyond the number of deaths that were typically expected based on pre-pandemic trends in mortality. When excess death rates are negative, this suggests that mortality was lower than expected. This measure is expressed in deaths per 100,000 residents.';

export const term_2_body =
  'Covid-19 death rates refer to the number of deaths that had Covid-19 listed as an underlying cause on death certificates. This measure is expressed in deaths per 100,000 residents.';
export const term_3_title = 'Potential Under-Counting';
export const term_3_body =
  'Potential under-counting refers to the extent to which Covid-19 death rates represent a complete account of excess death rates. If Covid-19 mortality only accounted for 80% of excess mortality, this suggests that up to 20% of Covid-19 deaths went uncounted. Some of these excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19 may be deaths indirectly related to the social, economic and health system consequences of the pandemic, but prior research indicates that most are uncounted Covid-19 deaths.';
export const term_4_title = 'Death Investigation System';
export const term_4_body =
  'Death investigation systems vary by state and county across the United States. States either have a medical examiner system, a coroner system, or a mixture of both. Counties either have a medical examiner, a coroner, a sheriff-coroner, or a justice of the peace. Coroners are elected, have limited medical training, and may be more likely to under-count Covid-19 deaths according to investigative reporting.';
