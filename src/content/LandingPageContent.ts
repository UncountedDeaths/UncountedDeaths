  'More than 170,000 deaths have gone uncounted across the US during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of these deaths are deaths indirectly related to the social, economic and health system consequences of the pandemic, but most are uncounted Covid-19 deaths. Excess mortality is a tool to measure the true mortality impact of the pandemic by comparing pandemic mortality to pre-pandemic mortality.';
