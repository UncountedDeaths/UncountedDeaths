# Datawrapper Automation Script

This script helps generate datawrapper graphs in a more automatic way. Currently it is partially complete.

# How it works

This script uses a series of templates(the JSON files in this folder) to apply settings to newly generated graphs. These
templates are mostly direct copies of the settings as retrieved from the API. Then, they have had placeholder put in
place of the actual data so that it can easily be updated and applied.

For example, it might have a placeholder for the state name, or map name etc.

Placeholders take the form of `&{place_holder_name}&`

When building these files start with a copy of the output from the
endpoint `https://api.datawrapper.de/v3/charts/{chart_id}`

Remove fields that can't be set/not relevant. The update all map specific info with placeholders that the script can
use.

# Updates vs creations

If you already created a graph and you have the ID, you can update that graph instead of creating another one. The
functions make how to do this pretty clear

# How to use

First, store your Datawrapper.de token in a `.env` file as follows

```
token=my_token
```

For actual prod generations we should use the CEID account vs personal aaccounts.

Nothing beyond this has been built yet

# Next Steps

The core of the program exists. What is missing are the parts to run things for all states etc. This means pulling data
like state names, file locations etc from some common file. Then using that to run the functions for each graph type.
Finally, outputting the data into something useful for the website.
